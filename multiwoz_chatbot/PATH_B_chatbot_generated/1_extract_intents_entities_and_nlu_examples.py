You are a RASA 3.1 assistant expert.

You will receive a list of English user utterances from real MultiWOZ dialogues. These cover domains such as restaurant, hotel, train, taxi, and attraction.

Your task is to extract structured training data and generate:

1. `nlu.yml`: intents and training examples
2. `slots`: the list of extracted entity names (used in entity annotations)

---

📄 OUTPUT FORMAT:

# nlu.yml
nlu:
  - intent: intent_name
    examples: |
      - example with one [value](entity)
      - another example with one [value](entity)
      - ...

# slots
- entity_name_1
- entity_name_2
- ...

---

📌 INSTRUCTIONS:
- 🔍 Extract the **maximum number of distinct intents and slots** from the utterances.
- ❗ Each intent must include **only one entity/slot type**.
- ✅ Each example must have exactly **one entity annotation**, using `[value](entity)` format.
- ✅ Group utterances with similar purpose and same slot into one intent.
- ❗ Do NOT include multiple slots per example or intent.
- ✅ Use realistic values from MultiWOZ (e.g., [north](area), [Italian](food), [cheap](price), [2](people), [01223 351707](phone))
- ❌ Do NOT include markdown, comments, or explanations.
- ✅ Include at least 5 diverse examples per intent.
- ❌ Do NOT include a `slots:` section in `nlu.yml`. Return it separately under `# slots`.

---

Here are the user utterances:
{examples}

Now return:
# nlu.yml
[...]

# slots
- ...
